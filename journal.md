The syntactic category is the following:

```
b = b1 < b2 | not b | etc.
```

The *semantics* is defined by compositional definitions of a function: There is
a semantic clause for each of the basis elements of the syntactic category and
one for each of the methods for constructing composite elements. The clauses for
composite elements are defined in terms of the semantics of the immediate
constituents of the elements.
